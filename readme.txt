Restrict access to communities in BuddyPress & BuddyBoss for free or premium members with the top WordPress membership plugin Paid Memberships Pro

== Description ==

### The most popular WordPress plugin for private communities.

Use BuddyPress or BuddyBoss with Paid Memberships Pro to create a members-only private community in your WordPress site. This plugin enables secure, private messaging, groups, member directories, and private profiles for members of your free or paid community.

This integration allows the site owner to control access to the most popular community features in BuddyPress and BuddyBoss.

### Restrict Community Features
Use this BuddyPress and BuddyBoss plugin to restrict your membership site for multiple user types including visitors, non-members, and members. Offer private groups, private messaging, a member directory, and more in your private social network.

* **Groups:** Restrict the ability for visitors and members to view, join, and create groups. You can also restrict access to the list of available groups in your community.
* **Messaging:** Restrict the ability for visitors and members to send public or private messages.
* **Friends:** Restrict the ability for visitors and members to send or accept friend requests.
* **Member Directories:** Restrict visitors and members from being included in the member directory.

### Restrict Forums and Community Discussions
If you include discussion boards and forums in your community, check out our [bbPress Integration](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-bbpress/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pmpro-bbpress). With BuddyPress or BuddyBoss and PMPro you can:

* **Restrict Forum Discussions** by Membership Level.
* **Assign a Forum Role** by Membership Level.
* **Adjust the error message shown** when a user does not have permission to view discussions.
* **Show a member's level name** in line with their discussion replies. This helps other community members see another member's access level.

### Compatible with BuddyPress and BuddyBoss

Like BuddyPress, the BuddyBoss Platform turns your WordPress site into a robust community, with social networking features including groups, discussions, messaging, friends, and more. Community users can organize themselves into public, private, or hidden social areas with separate activity feeds and directories.

The platform is an evolution of BuddyPress and bbPress, consolidated into a single area of settings. For this reason, you can use the existing PMPro Add Ons for BuddyPress and bbPress to restrict features in BuddyBoss.

== Installation ==

Note: You must have [Paid Memberships Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro/) and [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) or [BuddyBoss](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/buddyboss-membership-plugin/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pmpro-buddypress) installed and activated on your site.

### Install PMPro BuddyPress from within WordPress

1. Visit the plugins page within your dashboard and select "Add New"
1. Search for "PMPro BuddyPress"
1. Locate this plugin and click "Install"
1. Activate "Paid Memberships Pro - BuddyPress Integration" through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Go to "after activation" below.

### Install PMPro BuddyPress Manually

1. Upload the `pmpro-buddypress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate "Paid Memberships Pro - BuddyPress Integration" through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Go to "after activation" below.

### After Activation: Configure Plugin Settings

There are four primary settings areas in this plugin.

= 1. Select Your Preferred Registration Process =

This plugin allows you to use the BuddyPress or BuddyBoss user registration process (in place of the standard Paid Memberships Pro membership checkout process).

1. Navigate to Memberships > PMPro BuddyPress in the WordPress admin.
1. Change the "Registration Page" setting to "Use BuddyPress Registration Page".
1. Save Settings.

Note: If your membership is not free, you must use the Paid Memberships Pro membership checkout process. If you have a free community and want to allow users to register through BuddyPress or BuddyBoss, you must adjust this setting.

If you'd like members that register through the BuddyPress or BuddyBoss system to also be given a membership level, check out this guide on [setting a default level for all user registrations in WordPress](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/apply-a-buddypress-member-type-on-membership-checkout-or-level-change/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pmpro-buddypress).

= 2. Assign the "Access Restricted" Page =
Navigate to Memberships > Settings > Pages to create or edit the "Access Restricted" page.

This is the page that visitors and users are redirected to if they cannot access restricted BuddyPress or BuddyBoss features.

= 3. Configure Membership Level Settings =
Navigate to Memberships > Settings > Membership Levels and locate the "BuddyPress Restrictions" section.

From this section you can adjust settings for how you "unlock BuddyPress" for members of this level, including:

* Group Creation
* Single Group Viewing
* Groups Page Viewing
* Joining Groups
* Public Messaging
* Private Messaging
* Send Friend Requests
* Include in Member Directory

Next, adjust the "BuddyPress Group Membership" settings to add or invite members of this level to your existing BuddyPress Groups.

If you want to adjust BuddyPress Member Types, you must first create the types through custom code. [This post explains how to add Member Types to BuddyPress](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/apply-a-buddypress-member-type-on-membership-checkout-or-level-change/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pmpro-buddypress).

= 4. Configure Settings for Logged in Non Members =

Some of your WordPress users may not have a membership level in Paid Memberships Pro. This plugin allows you to set how BuddyPress should be locked down for these users without a membership level.

Navigate to Memberships > Settings > PMPro BuddyPress and locate the "Non-member User Settings" section.

[Read our full documentation on Non-Member Users in BuddyPress or BuddyBoss here](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/buddypress-integration/#non_member_user?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pmpro-buddypress).
